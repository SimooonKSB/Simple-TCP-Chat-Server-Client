# Simple-TCP-Chat-Server-Client
The goal of this project is to create a Client-Server System that allows two or more people to chat with a GUI.
For the GUI I am going to use JavaFX since swing look really bad nowadays. I also want to use TCP beacuase a Chat
System with UDP just sounds wrong and I dont even know if there would be any benefit in doing that.
